College applications is a daunting process, for those who have not started yet. In this post, we talk about the ways to best prepare yourself for college applications, from the software you use to how to organize your files.

## How to Use this Blog

Before we begin, I would like to point out a few resources that helped me along the process. A couple of my favorites are the [ApplyingToCollege subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/applyingtocollege) and the [master list of essay topics from CollegeVine](https://www.collegevine.com/college-essay-prompts/), which is extremely helpful down the road.

Now that you have a few resources to look into, letâ€™s go over how to use this website. This website is designed to give posts more relevant early in your college application process, and will progress to later action items in later pages. There will be some college specific posts at the end of the blog, which will also be linked at the bottom of this post.


## A Couple Things to Remember

So far you've worked really hard on school work, and you're finally ready to show it off to colleges. However, there are a few things to remember going into the process:

1. College applications is not a time to slack off. A lot of times, I see peers work tirelessly only to start to give up right when college applications start. Make sure you are not one of these people! Keep your mind in shape, but make sure to relax.

2. College applications is a long process. Make sure to go slow and steady, and spread out your work over a period of time.

## Setting Up Your Computer

I highly recommend that you use <a href="https://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> to manage your files. A free account will give you 2GB of storage, which is more than enough for your application essays.

The great thing about Dropbox is that it will automatically save your work to the cloud as you save your work. Even if your laptop dies out on you in the middle of the application process, you will be able to retrieve your work from ANY other device (including your phone, tablet, or another computer). In addition, it will save history reviison, which is a great way to ensure you don't want to lose any drafts that you liked.

### Naming Conventions

Keeping track of your files and their versions is extrmeely important. Another big part of writing is that you **never** want to delete anything you write, even if you think that its not suitable to submit. There are always times that you may want to look back on how you worded something specific.

Its easy to track if you name your files accordingly:

{% highlight markdown %}
[College]_[EssayTopic]_v[#].doc
{% endhighlight %}

For example,

{% highlight markdown %}
Princeton_Activity_v1.8.doc
{% endhighlight %}

Increase your version number everytime you receive feedback and make edits, or you feel as if you have made substantial changes from the pervious versions.

### Tracking Your Applications

Create a spreadhsheet with each part of your application. For example:

| College  | Essays Done  | Scores Sent | Deadline | Application Sent | Interviews | Decision | Portal URL |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Princeton | No | Yes | 1-Jan | No | No | Application Not Sent | princeton.edu |
| Columbia | Yes | Yes | 1-Jan | Yes | Yes - not assigned | Decision Not recieved | columbia.edu |
| Harvard | No | No | 1-Jan | No | Yes - not assigned | Application Not Sent | harvard.edu |

Make sure to keep this updated throughout the entire process - it will help you be able to quickly check what you need to do next,
and anything that may be coming up.
