When it comes around to asking for recommendations, there are a few things to be wary of.

## Teacher Recommendations


### Criteria for Choosing 

1. Make sure you are on good terms with the teacher, and have a reasonable grade in the class. Even if you think that the teacher would say yes, its important to make sure that the teacher has ample content to write about you.
2. Be wary of college requirements - some colleges, such as Columbia, require one teacher from humanities and one from STEM
3. Make sure to ask in person. NEVER ask a teacher over email. Its an impersonal gesture, and makes it much less likely for them to say yes
4. Be thankful of your teachers. Give them gifts for the holidays, and make sure to keep them updated throughout your entire process. Even when youâ€™re hearing back from schools, let them know!

### What to do when your teacher says yes

When your teacher does offer to write you a letter of reccomendation, offer to make a list of notable things you've done in the class / for the teacher that you think would help form the content of your letter.


## External Recommendations

Along with two teacher reccomendations, you have the option to send a third letter of reccomendation from somone else. This could be your boss, a coach, or even a family friend.

Often, I would not reccomend sending a third letter. This is because the letter may not be written well, and having your application reader read something that doesn't inherently add to your character may actually take away from other aspects of your application.
