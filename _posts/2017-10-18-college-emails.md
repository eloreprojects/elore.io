As soon as you take your SAT or ACT, colleges will begin to email you telling you about their amazing program, asking you to apply. At first this may not seem like a big deal, and actually kind of interesting as you want to see all the colleges that email you. However, if there is a college that you know you wonâ€™t be applying to you, *unsubscribe from that college email list*.

This will help you declutter your inbox for any emails so you don't have to constantly delete random emails. In addition, it will prevent you from missing any action emails from colleges you actually want to attend.

Make sure to keep all the emails you want. Make folders per college, and inside subcategorize them to include your visit, action items, and newsletters.
