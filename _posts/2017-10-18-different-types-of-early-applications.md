There are many different types of early applications. In this post, we'll talk a little bit more in depth about the different types of early applications, and what each entails.

## 1. Early Decision

For some, this can be the most daunting option. Early Decision means that your application is _binding_, or in other words, you must attend the college if you are accepted. You can only submit this type of application to one college.

Often, there is a strong advantage to applying early decision. If your first-choice college offers this option, applying early decision will show the admission officers your dedication to the school, increasing your chances. A strong example of this is Cornell, who has an acceptance rate of ~ 40% for early decision, compared to the ~ 15% acceptance rate for regular decision.

## 2. Early Action

Early action is a non binding application which you submit early. You can submit multiple EA to different colleges, along with an ED as well.

Although these applications show the admissions office you have more interest in their college. However, this application rarely gives a higher admittance rate. Thus, it is better to wait to regular decision if you believe you can submit a better application.

## 3. Restrictive Early Action

Restrictive early means that you cannot apply to any other school either early decision or early action (although terms can vary). Effectively, this means that this is the only application you can submit early. I would never recommend this as it prevents the opportunity for you to hold acceptances earlier, and doesnâ€™t boost your chances of being accepted.
