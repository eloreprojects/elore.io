There comes a point where you will want to visit a college. I recommend scheduling a trip during your school break to knock out many schools in the same vicinity in one go.

On these trips, you can sign up for information sessions and campus tours to learn more about he department you are thinking of applying into. These schools are very willing to showcase what they have to offer. Further than just learning about the school, point out things you like (that are specific) to help you write your “why” college statements. Some schools, such as Santa Clara University, will have its own prompt asking if you visited campus, and if so, what about it appealed to you.

In addition to those information sessions, see if you know anyone attending to ask them more about the school and their experience. Also, you can email professors before hand to learn more about the department. Personally, when I visited CMU, I emailed the a staff in the CS School, and she scheduled a meeting to talk with the full program with me.

In addition, check if they offer on campus interviews. These are a great way to express your interest in the school and give them a taste of your application outside of just the paper.
