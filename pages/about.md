elore is an organization dedicated to assisting aspiring computer scientists to become rockstars. We primarily develop and maintain open source technologies, providing new developers the opportunity to tinker with software being used in the real world. 

Recently we've begun publishing content through Medium to educate students on emerging topics in computer science such as machine learning cryptography and software engineering. Founded at a residential incubator MIT in 2016, elore's goal transformed from providing a centralized coding community to giving coders the tools to create their own.

Currently, elore is maintained by [Neeraj Aggarwal](https://neerajaggarwal.com) and [Arun Kirubarajan](https://kirubarajan.com/).
