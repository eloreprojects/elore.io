Elore was founded at a residential incubator at MIT in 2016 by [Neeraj Aggarwal](https://neerajaggarwal.com) and [Arun Kirubarajan](https://kirubarajan.com/).

Elore is an organization dedicated to assisting aspiring computer scientists to become rockstars. We primarily develop and maintain open source technologies, providing new developers the opportunity to tinker with software being used in the real world. Some our notable projects include [programjs](https://github.com/eloreprojects/programjs) and [crypt](https://github.com/eloreprojects/crypt).


Through our two years, our goal has transformed from providing a centralized coding community to giving coders the tools to create their own. Recently we've begun publishing blogs through our website to educate students on emerging topics in computer science such as machine learning, cryptography, and software engineering. In addition, we are running a college application series.
